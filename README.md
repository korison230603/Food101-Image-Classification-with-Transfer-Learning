# Food101-Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning

This project focuses on building a food image classification model using the Food101 dataset, which contains over 100,000 images across 101 food categories. The model is trained using a Transfer Learning approach to improve accuracy and training efficiency.

Key details:

Dataset: Food101

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Technique: Transfer Learning (pretrained CNN)

Output: A trained model capable of classifying food images into 101 categories with high performance.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to leverage pretrained models for large-scale image classification tasks and to compare the performance against models trained from scratch.
